> I build real products that solve real problems — from campus ecosystems to health & emergency platforms.  
> Focus: **MERN + Real-Time Systems + Scalable Cloud + Automation** — aiming for production-grade reliability and 1CR+ impact.

---

## TL;DR — What I ship
- ✅ Built **Donato**: real-time donation logistics (pilot: matching latency ↓ ~60%, coordination time ↓ ~55%).  
- ✅ Built **CollegeHub**: campus engagement platform (pilot engagement ↑ ~40–65%).  
- ✅ Built **JeevanRakshak360**: AI + blockchain health stack (early detection ↑ ~35–50%, emergency coordination speed ↑ ~40%).  
- ✅ Founder of **DevUp** (Dev ecosystem at VJIT) — impacted **300+ students**, running DevUp Labs, mentorship pipelines and industry collaborations.  
- ✅ **10+ hackathons**, **10+ events** led, **20+ real-world apps** built.  
- Tech focus: MERN, Node microservices, Fastify/Nest, Socket.io, Redis, Kafka/RabbitMQ basics, AWS/GCP/Azure, Docker, Kubernetes basics, serverless, n8n automation.

---

## Key highlights
- **Founder & Chief — DevUp Society**: created a one-stop developer ecosystem with roadmaps, real projects, and mentorship (50–70% engagement lift in pilots).  
- **Co-Founder — FNeX** (Foundation for Networking & Ethical Exchange): multi-college initiative for ethical freelancing & high-impact collaboration.  
- **Hackathon record**: 10+ participations across AI, HealthTech, EdTech & Real-Time Systems; multiple top placements and shortlisted entries.  
- **Cloud & certs**: foundational training across **AWS / Azure / GCP**, plus Full-Stack & Backend programs.  
- **Open source & community**: reusable templates, automation tools, starter kits and active mentoring on GitHub.

## Signature Projects (production-minded, impact-first)
> Each entry: short problem statement → what I built → measurable impact → tech line.

### Donato — Rapid Donation Mobility & Assistance Platform  
**Problem:** food & resource waste due to slow donor→NGO matching.  
**What I built:** location-based donor→NGO matching, verified onboarding, Rapido-style pickup (post → alert → accept → track → deliver), realtime tracking, chat, Twilio alerts, AI image checks and delivery proof.  
**Impact (pilot):** matching latency ↓ ~60%, coordination time ↓ ~55%.  
**Tech:** MERN, Redis, AWS S3, Socket.io, Google Maps, Twilio, Docker, JWT, GeoJSON, CI/CD

---

### CollegeHub — Unified Campus Engagement & Intelligent Ecosystem  
**Problem:** fragmented campus communication causing missed opportunities.  
**What I built:** multi-role platform (Student / Club / College / Super Admin), concurrency-safe registrations, QR check-ins, AI event discovery, real-time RSVPs, analytics and monetization workflows.  
**Impact (pilot):** campus engagement ↑ ~40–65%.  
**Tech:** Node.js microservices, MongoDB, Redis, React, Zustand, React Query, Socket.io, Docker, GitHub Actions, NGINX, CDN

---

### JeevanRakshak360 — AI & Blockchain Health Ecosystem  
**Problem:** migrants & communities lack trustworthy, fast emergency care pathways.  
**What I built:** AI symptom triage, predictive alerts, ambulance tracking + geo-routing, ABDM & scheme integrations, secure blockchain health vaults, multilingual chat/voice.  
**Impact (pilot):** early detection ↑ ~35–50%, emergency coordination speed ↑ ~40%.  
**Tech:** MERN, AI/ML pipelines, federated blockchain ledger, ABDM APIs, Socket.io, Twilio, Google Maps, AWS

---

### DevUp — One-Stop Developer Ecosystem & Mentorship Platform (Founder)  
**Problem:** fragmented learning, lack of hands-on mentorship for freshers.  
**What I built:** role-based dashboards, roadmaps, DevUp Labs (mentorship + founder interactions), real-time doubt support, project boards, leaderboards and internship pipelines.  
**Impact (pilot):** participation & engagement ↑ ~50–70%.  
**Tech:** MERN, Node microservices, TypeScript, Redis, Socket.io, n8n, CI/CD, Sentry, CloudFront

---

## More projects (compact showcase)
**ProConnect** (multi-college networking, ↑ ~40%), **Exams Portal** (result processing ↓ ~55%), **Accreditation Platform** (paperwork ↓ ~60%), **Doctor Appointment System** (MERN + n8n, bookings ↓ ~45%), **TradeNexa** (trading sim), **ApnaConnect** (WebRTC video), + **20+ micro tools** for automation & campus ops.

---

## How I build (my engineering approach)
1. **Problem → Metrics**: always define the KPI to improve (latency, throughput, UX time-to-complete).  
2. **Minimal Viable Production**: ship a secure MVP that can be scaled.  
3. **Reliability by default**: logging, monitoring, CI/CD, caching & rate-limits in day-one deploys.  
4. **Iterate with pilots**: instrument, measure, improve — reduce false positives, increase trust signals.  
5. **Documentation & onboarding**: developer-first README, Postman collection, Swagger/OpenAPI.
